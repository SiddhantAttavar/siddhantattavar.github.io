Tic-Tac-Toe, though a simple game to play between two friends, can offer a lot of insight into adversial search and the widely used minimax algorithm.

# Parts:
Today we will build a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game complete with a bot to play against users. This game will contain several interconnected components:
 - Game framework
 - Game UI
 - Minimax based bot

# Game framewok and UI
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game to implement. We start of with an empty 3Ã—3 game board. Each turn we allow the user (or bot) to make a move on an empty square. After completing the move, we check for any consecutive rows, columns or diagonals with the same token. Finally, we update the set of empty cells in the board, and flip the turn state.

This is what the code for the game looks like:
```python
# Import packages
from Bot import *
from json import load, dumps

class Game:
	'''This class describes the TicTacToe game

To ensure our game doesn't look like it came straight from the 80s, we can create a basic user interface for the game. The pygame package makes it very simple for us to create an interface that allows users to interact with the game.

# The minimax algorithm
The minimax algorithm is one of the simplest adversial search decision. Adversial search algorithms involve optimizing a certain heuristic score against an "adversary", the human player in this case. The minimax algorithm is used to minimize the potential loss in the worst case. The basic psuedocode for the minimax is extremely simple:
```
function minimax(ganeState, maximizingPlayer):
	if terminal node:
		return heuristic(gameState)
	
	if maximizingPlayer:
		res = -INF
	else:
		res = INF
	
	for nextState in possibleMoves(gameState):
		if maximizingPlayer:
			res = max(minimax(nextState), false)
		else:
			res = min(minimax(nextState), false)
	
	return res
```

The first thing we notice about the minimax algorithm is that it is a recursive algorithm. We start at the current game state, and recursively traverse down the game tree to the terminal nodes, which mark the end of the game. Each terminal node has a heuristic score, which the bot (the maximizing player) tries to increase, and the human opponent tries to decrease. 

In our game, the heuristic is very basic. Since we are only calculating the heuristic score at a terminal node, we can give 1 for a winning board, 0 for a tie, and -1 for a losing board.

For the sake of comparison, let us add 2 more bots, one that randomly selects an empty cell, and another that selects the immediate best move (greedy bot). The greedy bot first checks if it can complete a row, column or diagonal. If no such move is possible, the bot tries to block the opponent from completing 3 in a row. Finally, if there are no such threats, if reverts to the standard strategy of selecting a random empty cell to make a move.

Here's what the combined code of the 3 bots look like:
```python
'''This file contains the functions for different bots:

# The finished product:
After integrating all the components, here's what the completed game looks like:
![]()

Here's a comparison of the 3 bots:

To find the time complexity of our minimax bot, we need to look at the total number of moves possible in the worst case, i.e. an empty board. In the first move there are 9 possible moves. In the second move there are 8 possiblities since one of cells has already been occupied. This continues till all the cells have been occupied. In total, there are 9! possible sets of moves that can take place in a Tic-Tac-Toe game (approximately 360,000).As a rule of thumb, the average computer can compute 1e8 O(1) operations in a second. Since 9! is comfortably within that limit, there is no need for any additional optimization.

The minimax  decision rule is a simple but powerful algorithm, that can be extended to  many two player games like chess. In order to use the minimax algorithm on such complex games, we can utilize additional optimization techniques like alpha-beta pruning, as well as develop more comprehensive heuristic functions.
